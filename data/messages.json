As you can tell from the proforma this project\nshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.\nThis is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as\nAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for\nthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we\nhave uncovered to date in the Austin market.\nThe project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As\nit is in the \"Smart Growth Corridor\" area designated by the City of Austin\nfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete\nin less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe\nwater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot\nimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North\nAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street\nwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street\nwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond\nrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.\n The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not\nexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite\nsuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the\nadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.\nAs with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods\nis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may\nonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far\npreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer\npreferences.\nThe seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and\nan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site\nplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into\nan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.\nThis analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the\nprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss\nhaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity\nwith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a\n1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a\nrental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then\nbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an\nexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San\nAntonio if you do not know anyone.\nI will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,\nby Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.\nOnce you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to\nschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as\nyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any\ntime.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either\n512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is\n512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you\non this project that is sure to be a major winner.\nI regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual\nevents these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg\ndowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.\nOne of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to\nstart the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough\nto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took\nanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take\nmy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra\nin her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this\npast week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize\nthe enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as\nif she will be ok in the long run.\nGeorge W.

The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough\nto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took\nanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take\nmy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra\nin her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this\npast week..

As you can tell from the proforma this project\nshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.\nThis is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as\nAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for\nthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we\nhave uncovered to date in the Austin market.\nThe project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As\nit is in the \"Smart Growth Corridor\" area designated by the City of Austin\nfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete\nin less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe\nwater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot\nimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North\nAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street\nwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street\nwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond\nrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.\n The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not\nexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite\nsuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the\nadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.\nAs with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods\nis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may\nonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far\npreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer\npreferences.\nThe seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and\nan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site\nplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into\nan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.\nThis analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the\nprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss\nhaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity\nwith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a\n1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a\nrental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then\nbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an\nexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San\nAntonio if you do not know anyone.\nI will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,\nby Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.\nOnce you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to\nschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as\nyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any\ntime.

Crocker\" \n<clclegal2@aol.com> \nSubject: Investment Structure\n\n\nSTRUCTURE:\nTypically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)\ngeneral partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\nliability of construction.\n\nLAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\nThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\nany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\nthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\nall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\nloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits\nis reduced.\n\nAll loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\nfull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\nnon-recourse.\n\nUSE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\nThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\nCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\n\nEARLY LAND COSTS\nThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\nextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\n\nEQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN\nOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\nthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of\nimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the\nimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be\nfor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after\ncompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should\nexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot\nimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an\nirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a\ndevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not\nspent no interest is charged on these funds.\n\nThe lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a\nfinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as\nhigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\nper lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at\n$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000\nwhich means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to\nobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement\nprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the\nimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would\ncover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds\nspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the\npreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a\ntentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can\nsignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.\n\nPhasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total\nlot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably\n$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The\nimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design\ncosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and\nlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for\nundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would\nestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the\nloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give\nyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required\nof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing\nis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the\nseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility\nstandpoint.\n\nCONSTRUCTION LOANS\nThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative\n(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is\na construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the\nbuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction\nloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to\nstart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans\nin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any\nconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too\ndifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.\n\nSpec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for\npre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will\nbe from 80% to 95% of value.\n\nDISBURSEMENTS\nDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and\nnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority\npayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner\nwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the\nfee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to\n15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.\nThese fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to\ncalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership\nexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has\nto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or\ncannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this\nfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain\nfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.\nFinally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is\nused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own\nany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track\nto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.\n\nREPORTING\nWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.\nWhat did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based\nreporting.\n\nBOOKKEEPING\nI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeeping\nprocedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.\n\nINVESTOR INPUT\nWe are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always\nthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my\nexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume\nKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every\neffort to be accommodating.\n\nCREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES\nCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as\nformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market\nobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional\nsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,\nfor vendors they are constantly shopped.\n\nPRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS\nYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can\nprovide these if you are interested.\n\nI know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call\nwhen you have reviewed and we can discuss further.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGeorge Richards\nPresident, Creekside Builders, LLC\n\n\n\n\n - winmail.dat\n"

For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or\ncannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this\nfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain\nfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.\nFinally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is\nused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.

Crocker\" \n<clclegal2@aol.com> \nSubject: Investment Structure\n\n\nSTRUCTURE:\nTypically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)\ngeneral partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\nliability of construction.\n\nLAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\nThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\nany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\nthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\nall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\nloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits\nis reduced.\n\nAll loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\nfull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\nnon-recourse.\n\nUSE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\nThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\nCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\n\nEARLY LAND COSTS\nThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\nextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\n\nEQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN\nOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\nthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of\nimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the\nimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be\nfor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after\ncompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should\nexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot\nimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an\nirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a\ndevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not\nspent no interest is charged on these funds.\n\nThe lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a\nfinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as\nhigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\nper lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at\n$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000\nwhich means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to\nobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement\nprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the\nimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would\ncover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds\nspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the\npreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a\ntentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can\nsignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.\n\nPhasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total\nlot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably\n$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The\nimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design\ncosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and\nlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for\nundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would\nestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the\nloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give\nyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required\nof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing\nis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the\nseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility\nstandpoint.\n\nCONSTRUCTION LOANS\nThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative\n(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is\na construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the\nbuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction\nloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to\nstart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans\nin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any\nconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too\ndifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.\n\nSpec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for\npre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will\nbe from 80% to 95% of value.\n\nDISBURSEMENTS\nDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and\nnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority\npayments and then to the partners per the agreement.

Crocker\" \n<clclegal2@aol.com> \nSubject: Investment Structure\n\n\nSTRUCTURE:\nTypically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)\ngeneral partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\nliability of construction.\n\nLAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\nThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\nany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\nthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\nall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\nloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits\nis reduced.\n\nAll loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\nfull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\nnon-recourse.\n\nUSE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\nThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\nCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\n\nEARLY LAND COSTS\nThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\nextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\n\nEQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN\nOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\nthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of\nimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the\nimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be\nfor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after\ncompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should\nexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot\nimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an\nirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a\ndevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not\nspent no interest is charged on these funds.\n\nThe lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a\nfinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as\nhigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\nper lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at\n$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000\nwhich means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to\nobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement\nprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the\nimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would\ncover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds\nspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the\npreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a\ntentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can\nsignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.\n\nPhasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total\nlot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably\n$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The\nimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design\ncosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and\nlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for\nundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would\nestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the\nloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give\nyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required\nof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing\nis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the\nseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility\nstandpoint.\n\nCONSTRUCTION LOANS\nThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative\n(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is\na construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the\nbuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction\nloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to\nstart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans\nin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any\nconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too\ndifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.\n\nSpec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for\npre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will\nbe from 80% to 95% of value.\n\nDISBURSEMENTS\nDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and\nnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority\npayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner\nwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the\nfee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to\n15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.\nThese fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to\ncalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership\nexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has\nto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or\ncannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this\nfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain\nfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.\nFinally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is\nused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own\nany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track\nto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.\n\nREPORTING\nWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.\nWhat did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based\nreporting.\n\nBOOKKEEPING\nI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeeping\nprocedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.\n\nINVESTOR INPUT\nWe are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.

Crocker\" \n<clclegal2@aol.com> \nSubject: Investment Structure\n\n\nSTRUCTURE:\nTypically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)\ngeneral partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\nliability of construction.\n\nLAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\nThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\nany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\nthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\nall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\nloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits\nis reduced.\n\nAll loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\nfull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\nnon-recourse.\n\nUSE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\nThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\nCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\n\nEARLY LAND COSTS\nThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\nextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\n\nEQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN\nOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\nthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of\nimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the\nimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be\nfor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after\ncompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should\nexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot\nimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an\nirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a\ndevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not\nspent no interest is charged on these funds.\n\nThe lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a\nfinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as\nhigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\nper lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at\n$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000\nwhich means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to\nobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement\nprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the\nimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would\ncover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds\nspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the\npreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a\ntentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can\nsignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.\n\nPhasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total\nlot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably\n$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The\nimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design\ncosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and\nlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for\nundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would\nestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the\nloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give\nyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required\nof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing\nis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the\nseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility\nstandpoint.\n\nCONSTRUCTION LOANS\nThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative\n(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is\na construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the\nbuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction\nloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to\nstart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans\nin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any\nconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too\ndifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.\n\nSpec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for\npre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will\nbe from 80% to 95% of value.\n\nDISBURSEMENTS\nDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and\nnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority\npayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner\nwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the\nfee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to\n15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.\nThese fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to\ncalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership\nexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has\nto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or\ncannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this\nfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain\nfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.\nFinally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is\nused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own\nany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track\nto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.\n\nREPORTING\nWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.\nWhat did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based\nreporting.\n\nBOOKKEEPING\nI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeeping\nprocedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.\n\nINVESTOR INPUT\nWe are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always\nthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my\nexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume\nKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every\neffort to be accommodating.\n\nCREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES\nCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as\nformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market\nobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional\nsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,\nfor vendors they are constantly shopped.\n\nPRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS\nYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can\nprovide these if you are interested.\n\nI know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call\nwhen you have reviewed and we can discuss further.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGeorge Richards\nPresident, Creekside Builders, LLC\n\n\n\n\n - winmail.dat\n"

The\nimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design\ncosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and\nlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for\nundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would\nestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the\nloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give\nyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required\nof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing\nis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the\nseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility\nstandpoint.\n\nCONSTRUCTION LOANS\nThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative\n(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is\na construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the\nbuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction\nloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to\nstart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans\nin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any\nconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too\ndifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.\n\nSpec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for\npre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will\nbe from 80% to 95% of value.\n\nDISBURSEMENTS\nDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and\nnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority\npayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner\nwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the\nfee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to\n15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.\nThese fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to\ncalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership\nexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has\nto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or\ncannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this\nfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain\nfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.\nFinally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is\nused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own\nany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track\nto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.\n\nREPORTING\nWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.\nWhat did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based\nreporting.\n\nBOOKKEEPING\nI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeeping\nprocedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.\n\nINVESTOR INPUT\nWe are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always\nthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my\nexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume\nKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every\neffort to be accommodating.\n\nCREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES\nCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as\nformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market\nobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional\nsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,\nfor vendors they are constantly shopped.\n\nPRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS\nYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can\nprovide these if you are interested.\n\nI know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.

Crocker\" \n<clclegal2@aol.com> \nSubject: Investment Structure\n\n\nSTRUCTURE:\nTypically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)\ngeneral partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\nliability of construction.\n\nLAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\nThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\nany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\nthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\nall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\nloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits\nis reduced.\n\nAll loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\nfull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\nnon-recourse.\n\nUSE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\nThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\nCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\n\nEARLY LAND COSTS\nThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\nextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\n\nEQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN\nOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\nthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of\nimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the\nimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be\nfor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after\ncompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should\nexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot\nimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an\nirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a\ndevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not\nspent no interest is charged on these funds.\n\nThe lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a\nfinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as\nhigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\nper lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at\n$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000\nwhich means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to\nobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement\nprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the\nimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would\ncover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds\nspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the\npreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that \nthe final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large \npart on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which \nthe keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman \nbegan his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or \nanswer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had \nsome enlightening comments which relate to price caps:\n\nPrice caps are almost never the right answer\nPrice Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages\nCompetitive choices for consumers is the right answer\nAny solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce \ndemand, is not acceptable\nEight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would \nexport California's problems to the West\n\nThis is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty \nstrong anti- price cap position.

You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares\nbut are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:\nthe value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil\nexploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very\nviability\nof Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, the\ncompany under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But if\nthe project succeeds, the value of the company under current management\ncould be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 are\nconsidered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worth\nconsiderably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.\nIn fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company\nwill be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under\nCompany T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under\neither\nmanagement.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under\ncurrent management, the value under Company A is $75/share.

From all indications,\nCompany T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a\nprofitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the\npotential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T to\ndelay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then\naccept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches\nthe press.\n\n     Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration\nproject\nwhen submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when\ndeciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will\naccept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of\nthe company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for\ninstance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is\nanything less than $50.\n\n     As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price\noffers\nin the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to\n$150/share.

You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number is\nallowed, not an algebraic equation.\n\nAcquiring a Company\n\n     In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),\nwhich is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of\na tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares\nbut are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:\nthe value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil\nexploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very\nviability\nof Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, the\ncompany under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But if\nthe project succeeds, the value of the company under current management\ncould be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 are\nconsidered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worth\nconsiderably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.\nIn fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company\nwill be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under\nCompany T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under\neither\nmanagement.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under\ncurrent management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a\n$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company\nA,\nand so on.\n\n     The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the\nprice\nthey should offer for Company T's shares.  This offer must be made now,\nbefore the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,\nCompany T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a\nprofitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the\npotential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T to\ndelay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then\naccept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches\nthe press.\n\n     Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration\nproject\nwhen submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when\ndeciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will\naccept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of\nthe company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for\ninstance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is\nanything less than $50.\n\n     As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price\noffers\nin the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to\n$150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's\nstock?\n\n     $______ per/share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

So if you flip heads 3 times and then tails, you get $4.  What's\nyou bid/offer on playing this game?  (would you pay $.5 to play? $1? $2?\nwhat you charge me play against you?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number is\nallowed, not an algebraic equation.\n\nAcquiring a Company\n\n     In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),\nwhich is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of\na tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares\nbut are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:\nthe value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil\nexploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very\nviability\nof Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, the\ncompany under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But if\nthe project succeeds, the value of the company under current management\ncould be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 are\nconsidered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worth\nconsiderably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.\nIn fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company\nwill be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under\nCompany T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under\neither\nmanagement.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under\ncurrent management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a\n$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company\nA,\nand so on.\n\n     The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the\nprice\nthey should offer for Company T's shares.  This offer must be made now,\nbefore the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,\nCompany T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a\nprofitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the\npotential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T to\ndelay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then\naccept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches\nthe press.\n\n     Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration\nproject\nwhen submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when\ndeciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will\naccept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of\nthe company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for\ninstance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is\nanything less than $50.\n\n     As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price\noffers\nin the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to\n$150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's\nstock?\n\n     $______ per/share\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
